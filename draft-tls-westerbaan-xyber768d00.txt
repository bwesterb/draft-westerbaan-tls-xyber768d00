1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The final draft for Kyber is expected in 2024.  There are already
   early deployments of post-quantum key agreement, with more to come
   before Kyber is standardised.  To promote interoperability of early
   implementations, this document specifies a preliminary hybrid post-
   quantum key agreement.

1.2.  Warning: relation with X25519Kyber768Draft00 for HPKE

   In [hpkexyber] a hybrid KEM with the same name is defined for use in
   HPKE.  It differs from the hybrid KEM implicit in this document: here
   we use the X25519 shared secret directly, whereas in [hpkexyber], the
   ephemeral X25519 public key (ciphertext) is mixed in.  For use in
   HPKE this is required to be IND-CCA2 robust.  This is not required
   for use in TLS 1.3, thanks to the inclusion of the keyshare in the
   message transcript.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Construction

   We instantiate draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-06 with X25519 [rfc7748]
   and Kyber768Draft00 [kyber].  The latter is Kyber as submitted to
   round 3 of the NIST PQC process [KyberV302].

   For the client's share, the key_exchange value contains the
   concatenation of the client's X25519 ephemeral share (32 bytes) and
   the client's Kyber768Draft00 public key (1184 bytes).  The resulting
   key_exchange value is 1216 bytes in length.

   For the server's share, the key_exchange value contains the
   concatenation of the server's X25519 ephemeral share (32 bytes) and
   the Kyber768Draft00 ciphertext (1088 bytes) returned from
   encapsulation for the client's public key.  The resulting
   key_exchange value is 1120 bytes in length.

   The shared secret is calculated as the concatenation of the X25519
   shared secret (32 bytes) and the Kyber768Draft00 shared secret (32
   bytes).  The resulting shared secret value is 64 bytes in length.

4.  Security Considerations

   For TLS 1.3, this concatenation approach provides a secure key
   exchange if either component key exchange methods (X25519 or
   Kyber768Draft00) are secure [hybrid].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests/registers a new entry to the TLS Named Group
   (or Supported Group) registry, according to the procedures in
   Section 6 of [tlsiana].
